{"name":"iFaceRecognization","tagline":"Developed with OpenCV and NDK","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis is A project for a application of Face Recognizing based on Android.\r\nFor this Application,we have three activities,of which one for the MainPage,one for test,and a third one for real-time tracking and recognizing human faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n1. Implement the algorithm of detecting and Recognizing faces using both EigenFace and FisherFace with the help of OpenCV.\r\n2. Capable of detecting the positoin of eye corner and iris center accurately,the goal of wich is achived with properly calculated binarization.\r\n### Contact Me\r\nState Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications,BUPT\r\nHaidian District,Beijing\r\n \r\nSchool of Physics and Engineering(SPE),Sun Yat-Sen University\r\nGuangzhou,Guangdong Prov.China\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
